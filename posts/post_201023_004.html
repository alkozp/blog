        <p>The role of presentation is a very special role because it actually removes the semantics of an element. If you do this to an interactive or focusable element, an assistive technology user will not know what that element is for or how to use it, it may even be ignored, even if it is still actionable.</p>
        <p>Aria-hidden is a state that effectively hides that element from assistive technology users. Again, ARIA just describes things, it doesn’t affect appearance or functionality the way HTML attributes might. When you use aria-hidden=”true” on an element, it’s still rendered visibly on the screen. Doing this on an interactive element hides the presence of that element, which can again create a serious barrier to your users. Proper ways to hide elements is a separate subject, but for now, just know that role=”presentation” and aria-hidden=”true” can be very dangerous if not fully understood and used properly.</p>
