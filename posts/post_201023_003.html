        <p>Hopefully, the third rule of ARIA should be familiar to you already: all interactive ARIA roles need to be operable by keyboard. If functionality is provided via mouse, touch or any other method of input, it also needs to be available by keyboard.</p>
        <p>Keyboard support is absolutely fundamental to accessibility, and part of fulfilling the contract of semantics. Additionally, ensuring keyboard support will get you a long way with other input modalities you may not have expected, such as game controllers for example.</p>
