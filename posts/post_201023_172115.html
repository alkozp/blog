        <p>This may remind you of some sort of Fight Club rule (and ARIA can definitely cause a lot of fights), but you will often hear people say “Don’t use ARIA!” If you have heard this and were confused, it’s because “Don’t use ARIA” is actually an incomplete rule: the entire rule is don’t use ARIA if you can use HTML instead. The second part is almost always left off, but it’s really important.</p>
        <p>As I mentioned in the overview of the ARIA standard, ARIA is used to describe widget role semantics and state. A lot of this can be covered by existing HTML elements and properties. If you can use the HTML counterpart first and it’s supported by browsers and assistive technologies, then you’re better off just using the HTML because it will provide all the same properties as ARIA while providing a more stable experience.</p>
